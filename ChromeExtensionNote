Chrome extensions are small programs tha add functionality to the chrome browser
Prerequisites: HTML - CSS - JS
THE BIG PICTURE
Manifest + HTML + CSS + JS = .crx zipped file = Chrome Web Store

3 Types of Chrome Extension
1. Browser Action Extensions:
- stays in browser tool bar and it is accessible at all times
2. Page Action Extension
- works only on certain pages that is already decided by the developer
- it stays in tool bar but it is greyed out
3. Neither BA or PA - runs in the background

First step to creating chrome extension is to write the manifest file

MANIFEST
Manifest file is a special file that contains information about the chrome extension
Manifest is a JSON formatted file
Manifest must contain:
- Manifest version
- Name of extension
- Version of extension
- Description of extension
- Specify icons that represent the extension - google recommends that one provide three icons of different sizes 128x128 , 48x48 , 16x16 so that it can choose the right icon depending on where it the extension is being displayed

SUMMARY FOR MANIFEST
{
    "manifest_version" : 3,
    "name": "Hello World",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Hello World Extension",
    "icons": {
        "128": "icon128.jpeg",
        "48": "icon48.jpeg",
        "16": "icon16.jpeg"
    },
    "browser-action": {
        "default_icon":"icon16.jpeg", 
        "default_popup": "popup.html"
    }
}
